## Blog

"I write to taste life twice." I enjoy writing about interesting problems I encounter every day. Personally, I believe that every problem presents a unique approach, leading to specific solutions. I'm a firm believer that in engineering, there's no definitive right or wrong; it's all about making tradeoffs.

I write on my blog: **[https://irshadibagas.com](https://irshadibagas.com/)**. Hopefully consistentlyâ€¦.

## Button Toggle Dark Mode

Who wouldn't appreciate a well-crafted UI (and UX)? This marks the debut of my personally published package â€“ a straightforward button designed to facilitate theme cycling/toggling for fellow React developers. I believe it offers a pleasant experience, and my intention is to contribute it to the community and share the goodness around.

## Tinkering with GraphQL

This project dates back to the early stages of my career, where I undertook the task of creating a basic PokÃ©mon app using GraphQL. As part of this project, I introduced a unique element â€“ incorporating various PokÃ©mon logic calculations by utilizing promises (as a means to grasp the concept of JavaScript promises). The project underwent testing with Cypress.
